<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>
This extension does not collect, transmit, or store any personal, financial, or tax data. 
All processing is performed locally within the user's browser. 
The extension only interacts with the official <strong>https://coretaxdjp.pajak.go.id/</strong> website 
to automate the process of downloading tax invoices in PDF format.
</p>

<p>
No information is sent to external servers, and no tracking, analytics, or advertising frameworks are included.
</p>

<p>
An optional QRIS donation feature is provided for users who wish to support the developer. 
This donation feature is <em>entirely separate from the extensionâ€™s functionality</em> 
and does not involve or require any user tax or financial data.
